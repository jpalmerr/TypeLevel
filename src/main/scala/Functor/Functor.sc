/*
Functor is a type class that abstracts over type constructors that can be mapâ€˜ed over

A Functor instance must obey two laws:

Composition:
   - Mapping with f and then again with g is the same as mapping once with the composition of f and g
          -fa.map(f).map(g) = fa.map(f.andThen(g))

Identity:
    - Mapping with the identity function is a no-op
          - fa.map(x => x) = fa


Useful for when you're trying to map nested data types...
