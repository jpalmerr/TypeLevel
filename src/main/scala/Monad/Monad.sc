/* Monad instances

If Applicative is already present and flatten is well-behaved,
extending the Applicative to a Monad is trivial.

flatMap is just map followed by flatten.
Conversely, flatten is just flatMap using the identity function x => x

// FlatMap - a weakened Monad

// A closely related type class is FlatMap which is identical to Monad, minus the pure method.
// The laws for FlatMap are just the laws of Monad that donâ€™t mention pure.
